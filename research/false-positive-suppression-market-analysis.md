# False Positive Suppression: Market Analysis

**Date**: January 2026
**Author**: Security Engineering Team
**Status**: Research Complete

---

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes how leading security tools handle false positive suppression and finding management. The research covers 10+ tools across SAST, SCA, secrets detection, and vulnerability management categories.

**Key Finding**: The industry is moving toward **platform-controlled suppression with approval workflows**, away from simple in-code annotations. GitHub's Delegated Alert Dismissal (GA July 2025) and Snyk's Consistent Ignores (default June 2025) exemplify this trend.

## Tool-by-Tool Analysis

### 1. Snyk

**Source**: [Snyk Ignore Issues Docs](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/ignore-issues)

#### Suppression Methods

| Method | Control Level | Audit Trail |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `.snyk` policy file | Repository | Limited |
| `snyk ignore` CLI | Repository | Limited |
| Web UI ignore | Platform | Full |
| API ignore | Platform | Full |

#### Key Features (2025)

- **Consistent Ignores** (Default since June 19, 2025): Once an ignore is created, it is consistently respected regardless of how/where the test is run and what branch is being tested
- **Admin-Only Ignores**: Can restrict ignore capability to Group and Org Admin users only
- **Required Justification**: Can require a reason for each ignore
- **Expiration Dates**: CLI supports `--expiry` parameter

#### Administrative Controls

```
Organization Settings > General > Ignores:
- "Group and Org Admin users (Default user roles only)"
- "Require reason for each ignore" = Required
```

#### Verdict

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Developer Control | Configurable | Can be admin-only |
| Audit Trail | Good | Platform tracks who/when |
| Expiration | Yes | Via CLI `--expiry` |
| Approval Workflow | Partial | Admin-only setting acts as gate |

## Industry Trends (2025-2026)

### 1. Platform-Controlled Suppression

**Trend**: Moving away from in-code annotations toward platform-managed suppressions.

**Evidence**:
- GitHub Delegated Alert Dismissal (GA July 2025)
- Snyk Consistent Ignores (Default June 2025)
- Checkmarx Proposed Not Exploitable workflow

### 2. Approval Workflows

**Trend**: Requiring security team approval before findings are suppressed.

**Evidence**:
- Veracode's Mitigation Approver role
- Checkmarx's two-step Not Exploitable flow
- GitHub's delegated dismissal with custom roles

### 3. Expiration and Auto-Reactivation

**Trend**: Time-limited suppressions that auto-expire.

**Evidence**:
- DefectDojo's Risk Acceptance expiration
- Snyk's CLI `--expiry` parameter
- Industry best practice for risk acceptance

### 4. AI-Assisted Triage

**Trend**: Using AI to auto-classify false positives.

**Evidence**:
- Semgrep's AI Auto-Ignore
- Claims of 80-90% false positive reduction

### 5. Policy-as-Code

**Trend**: Using policy languages for suppression rules.

**Evidence**:
- Trivy's OPA Rego support
- GitLab's Vulnerability Management Policies

## Recommendations for Rediver

Based on this analysis, we recommend:

### Tier 1: Must Have

1. **Platform-Only Suppression**: No in-code annotations respected
2. **Approval Workflow**: Developer requests → Security approves
3. **Expiration Dates**: Maximum 1 year, recommended 90 days
4. **Full Audit Trail**: Who, when, why, approved_by

### Tier 2: Should Have

1. **Role-Based Permissions**: Separate request/approve permissions
2. **Bulk Operations**: Suppress similar findings at once
3. **API Access**: REST API for automation
4. **Notification Integration**: Alert on pending requests

### Tier 3: Nice to Have

1. **AI Auto-Triage**: Suggest likely false positives
2. **Policy-as-Code**: OPA/Rego for complex rules
3. **JIRA/Ticket Integration**: Create tickets for review
4. **SLA Integration**: Tie to security SLAs

## Appendix: False Positive Statistics

From [Snyk Research (May 2025)](https://snyk.io/blog/minimizing-false-positives-enhancing-security-efficiency/):

> "70% of a security team's time is spent investigating alerts that are false positives, wasting massive amounts of time in the investigation rather than working on proactive security measures."

> "33% of companies have been late in responding to actual cyberattacks because their teams were busy with these phantom threats."

This underscores the importance of effective false positive management in security operations.
